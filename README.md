## Predicting Bank Marketing Success using Decision Tree
This project focuses on building a Decision Tree model to predict the success of marketing campaigns in the banking industry, specifically whether a customer will subscribe to a bank deposit or not. The model was developed using the rpart library in R and its performance was evaluated using a test dataset. The accuracy of the Decision Tree model was found to be 89.8%, which indicates a high success rate in predicting subscription decisions. Visualization techniques, such as plotting the Decision Tree and displaying the prediction results, were used to provide a comprehensive understanding of the model structure and prediction results. Analysis of the results highlights the importance of features that influence deposit subscription decisions and provides insights for more effective marketing strategies. It is important to note that Decision Tree is one of several predictive modeling techniques, and further research can explore the performance of other methods to improve prediction accuracy.
